Charles Wallace Jeffries


The purpose of this project was to simulate Minneapolis' metro transit service route 3. The "main" method of the simulation can be found under the BusSim.java class, and is where the code for the simulation can be tested. This program was written in Intellij. 

The queues for the bus stops were stored in an array, and can be found under the "Stop.Java" class. The buses were arrays of type "Rider" (an object created in the Rider.Java class) and had a capacity of 50 people. Upon running the code you will be presented with the option to run the simulation over a full day (24 hours), half of a day (12 hours), or during rush hour (3 hours). If you wish to run the simulation over a full day enter "day", half of a day enter "half", or during rush hour enter "rush".

There are 2 types of buses, regular and express. Regular Buses service all stops, whereas express buses only serve downtown stops (0, 1, 14, 15, 16, and 29).

Inside the code, there are also comments that detail my thought process. Hopefully they can provide some insight as to what my thought process was, and how I carried out specific functions.

Thank you very much.

Best,
Charlie
